This repository is a [qmk_userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_external_userspace). These keymaps are supplementary to [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
The firmware enables a variety of additional features for Ploopy trackballs and mice and allows their configuration with Via interface.

## What does it do?
1. Configure 5 **DPI** presets and select between them
   Apply a global multiplier to DPI
2. **Invert** pointer or dragscroll direction
3. **Mouse Jiggler** _I am not liable for any disciplinary action taken by your employer!_
4. **Gestures**, similar to _"Wiggleball"_ 
5. Enable/disable dragscroll with caps/num/scroll lock.
6. Dragscroll tapdance; scrolling while held, and double tap to "lock" it on.

## How do I use it?
1. Download and flash the firmware `insert link to flashing guide`
2. Import the json file to Via

## What doesn't it do?
### Stuff that I think is possible, and may implement later
1. "Sniper" mode  -- momentarily reduce DPI by some factor while "sniper" key held
2. Dragscroll DPI or divisor control

### Stuff I would like to do, but have no earthly idea how to achieve
1. Scroll by moving the pointer in a circle 
2. Use a text input box for DPI presets rather than a dropdown list
3. world peace
