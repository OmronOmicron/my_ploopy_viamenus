# Plodah's Via Menus for Ploopy
![alt text](readme-examplemenu.png)

This is a [qmk_userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_external_userspace) containing supplementar keymaps for [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
This produces firmware that includes a variety of additional features for Ploopy trackballs which can be configured within Via.

## Please Note
Testing on this has been limited. I had all this stuff in my qmk_userspace repo, mixed in with a bunch of keyboard stuff.
I've tested this on my Adept and Thumb .. but not extensively.
If there are problems, let me know or PR a fix.

## What does it do?
### DPI Config
Configure 5 **DPI** presets and switch between them.
Can additionally apply global multiplier to DPI
### Dragscroll
Kinda improved version of dragscroll. 
- Momentary and Toggle keys available.
- Tapdance, which will act as a momentary dragscroll, but when tapped twice will toggle
- Enable/disable dragscroll with caps/num/scroll lock
- If toggled on, it will be deactivated by another key press
- invert dragscroll direction for x/y independently

### Mouse Jiggler 
The pointer will move an imperceptably small amount, in a pseudo-random direction at a pseudo-random interval.
This should be enough to keep your computer awake when you're not using it, but since it's only 1-2 px at a time, it's small enough that it doesn't hinder normal mouse usage.
_I am not liable for any disciplinary action taken by your employer!_
The jiggler will draw a circle to confirm it has been enabled, and a horizontal line to show when it's turned off.
Can be switched on/off by key press, via menu or gesture.

### Gestures
Similar to _"Wiggleball"_ 
Wiggle the cursor to enable dragscroll or mouse jiggler (or not, if you prefer)
### Task Switcher
Keys allow you to "alt tab" between open Windows. 
Alt is held for ~1 second after this key released to allow switching between several windows.

## How do I use it?
1. Download firmware from [**Releases**](https://github.com/plodah/ploopy_viamenus/releases)
2. Flash the firmware; e.g. with QMK toolbox. [Here is QMK's guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_flashing)
3. Import the json file to Via's üñåÔ∏è design tab. If you don't have üñåÔ∏è at the top of the Via, enable design tab it in settings ‚öôÔ∏è
4. When updating to a new release, please update both firmware and Via JSON

### Problems and workarounds
#### Tapdance and Community Module keycodes
Several keys that are implemented in this firmware are not in "ranges" that are supported properly by Via.
These will show as their hexidecimal keycode in Via and can only be assigned with the same;
| Key | Code | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Dragscroll Tapdance | `0x5700` | Momentary dragscroll, toggles when tapped twice |
| Mouse Jiggler | `0x77c0` | |
| Taskswitch Next | `0x77c1` | i.e. Alt + Tab |
| Taskswitch Prev | `0x77c2` | i.e. Alt + Shift + Tab |

## What doesn't it do?
### Stuff that I think is possible, and may implement later
1. "Sniper" mode  -- momentarily reduce DPI by some factor while "sniper" key held.
2. Dragscroll DPI or divisor control.
3. Turbo keys/buttons. -- repeatedly send a click at a certain interval.
4. Dragscroll ends on other key press. make this optional.
5. The way I've set things up, Via uses only 1 byte for DPI. 
   The value (0-255) is multiplied by 10 when applying the DPI, meaning the limit is 2550. 
   Should make this a 2 byte value, and directly apply without this calculation.

### Stuff I would like to do, but have no earthly idea how to achieve
1. Scroll by moving the pointer in a circle.
2. Use a text input box for DPI presets rather than a dropdown list.
3. Provide a better interface for tapdances and community module keycodes.
